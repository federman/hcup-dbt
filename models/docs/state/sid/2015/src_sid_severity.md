{% docs sid_severity_2015_description %}

The **Disease Severity Measures File** is a discharge-level file that contains information from the AHRQ Comorbidity Software. Information from these severity files is to be used in conjunction with the Inpatient Core files. The unit of observation is an inpatient stay record. The HCUP unique record identifier (KEY) provides the linkage between the Core files and the Disease Severity Measures files. These files are available beginning with the 2005 SID.
