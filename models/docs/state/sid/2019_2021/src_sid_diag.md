Diagnosis and Procedure Groups File is a discharge-level file that contains data elements from AHRQ software tools designed to facilitate the use of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM/PCS) diagnostic and procedure information in the HCUP databases. The unit of observation is an inpatient stay record. The HCUP unique record identifier (KEY) provides the linkage between the Core files and the Diagnosis and Procedure Groups files. These files are available beginning with the 2019 SID.
