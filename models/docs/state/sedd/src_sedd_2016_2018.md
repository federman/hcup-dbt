**What is the File Structure of the SEDD in the 2016-2018 Files?**

Based on the availability of data elements across States, data elements included in the 2016 SEDD are structured as follows:

- Core file
- Charges file
- AHA Linkage file

Unavailable with the 2016-2018 SEDD is the Diagnosis and Procedure Groups file that had been included with the SEDD in prior data years. The data elements included in that file were derived from AHRQ software tools. If you are interested in applying the AHRQ software tools to the ICD-10-CM/PCS data in the 2016-2018 SEDD, beta versions of the AHRQ software tools are available on the HCUP User Support website at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp. Also available is a tutorial on how to apply the AHRQ software tools to the HCUP databases at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/tutorials.jsp.
