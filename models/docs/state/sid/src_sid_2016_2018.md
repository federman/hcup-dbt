What is the File Structure of the SID in the 2016-2018 Files?

Based on the availability of data elements across States, data elements included in the 2016-2018 SID are structured as follows:

- Core file
- Charges file
- AHA Linkage file

Unavailable with the 2016-2018 SID are two file types that had been included with the SID in prior data years: the Diagnosis and Procedure Groups file and the Disease Severity file. The data elements included in those two files were derived from AHRQ software tools. If you are interested in applying the AHRQ software tools to the ICD-10-CM/PCS data in the 2016-2018 SID, beta versions of the AHRQ software tools are available on the HCUP User Support website at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp. Also available is a tutorial on how to apply the AHRQ software tools to the HCUP databases at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/tutorials.jsp.
